### About the project

Developed an educational game that seeks to teach about the history of the First World War in a playful and interactive way. Unity engine is used as a basis to create this innovative project, which aims to make learning more enjoyable and memorable for all students involved.

Among the objectives of the game, we highlight the construction of scenarios and environments replicating the battlefields of the First World War, fully stylized characters with the typical clothes and weapons of the time and the creation of an intuitive gameplay system that allows the player to interact naturally with the game.

This is a unique way of learning as it combines traditional teaching methods with the use of games. The game allows students to engage in activities that will help them learn about World War I.
